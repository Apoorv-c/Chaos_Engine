⭐ Recommended (Balanced & Professional)

Chaos Engine is a custom-built game engine written in C++ with OpenGL, designed to explore low-level engine architecture and real-time rendering systems.
The project focuses on clean engine design, modular subsystems, and hands-on implementation of core concepts such as window management, input abstraction, rendering pipelines, shaders, and engine lifecycle management.

Built from scratch as a long-term learning and experimentation project.

🔥 Slightly Bolder (Still Professional)

Chaos Engine is a from-scratch C++ game engine aimed at understanding how modern game engines work under the hood.
It features a custom engine core, renderer abstraction, OpenGL-based rendering, shader management, input handling, and a structured application loop — built without relying on existing engines or frameworks.

This project prioritizes architecture, performance awareness, and clean separation of systems.

🧠 Technical / Recruiter-Friendly

A modular C++ game engine built from scratch using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLAD.
The engine implements a custom application layer, renderer abstraction, input system, logging, timing, shader compilation, and GPU-driven rendering.
The goal of the project is to gain deep practical knowledge of engine internals, rendering pipelines, and system-level design.

🧪 Minimal (Clean & Sharp)

A custom C++ / OpenGL game engine built from scratch to study engine architecture, rendering systems, and low-level graphics programming.
