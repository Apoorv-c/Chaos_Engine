Chaos Engine is a custom-built game engine written in C++ with OpenGL, designed to explore low-level engine architecture and real-time rendering systems.
The project focuses on clean engine design, modular subsystems, and hands-on implementation of core concepts such as window management, input abstraction, rendering pipelines, shaders, and engine lifecycle management.

Built from scratch as a long-term learning and experimentation project.
